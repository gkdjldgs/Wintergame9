# Wintergame
You are a penguin during winter.

Theme

This weeks theme was winter, the game's general setting is based off of winter and the player is a penguin.
The game has the aesthtic as well. (Snow falling, ice freezing over, snow covering the ground)

I started off by adding a simple 2d Snow Particle effect which went pretty well!

This was due to RoyasThanks"Make 2D Snow Particle Effect In Godot In 2 Minutes"

And then I kinda figured out what I wanted to do by trying new things this week, 
things that I would never usually get to do due to time
So I spent abit drawing and animating water in illustrator
After a while I was able to complete this and it turned out good.
