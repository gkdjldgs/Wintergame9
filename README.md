Theme

This weeks theme was winter, the game's general setting is based off of winter and the player is a penguin.
The game has the aesthtic as well. (Snow falling, ice freezing over, snow covering the ground)

I started off by adding a simple 2d Snow Particle effect which went pretty well!

This was due to RoyasThanks"Make 2D Snow Particle Effect In Godot In 2 Minutes"

And then I kinda figured out what I wanted to do by trying new things this week, 
things that I would never usually get to do due to time
So I spent abit drawing and animating water in illustrator
After a while I was able to complete this and it turned out good.

This was following the tutorial by Eart Graphics 'How To Create A Realistic Water Texture in Adobe Illustrator'

And then I decided to take some time.. to draw a penguin going in 4 directions which was intresting
cause usually my characters face one direction or just at the cursor

but then here is where it starts to fall a p a r t.

SO what did I waste my life on for like the rest of the time?

1. I thought about it, hey wouldn't this be a good fishing game? So I add a bridge to act as the fishing spot,
   but when it comes to actual fishing.. It was too complicated. There were so many hard ways to implement it in the game
   that it was really starting to burn me out. I found this out the hard way as I spent 2 HOURS drawing fish because
   I thought it would work out. It also took me along, long time to draw an animation of the penguin fishing.
   So all those efforts kinda fell in a garbage as it didn't work out.
2. The confusion continued as I then decided to try and add animations to the game. So i foolishly worked on animating
   that by hand. A good amount of hours wasted by that

So basically a combination of bad planning, burnout and really bad decisions made my worse proj ever. 

And then it was too big to fit on itch.io, so thats great.
Mb guys I'll do better next week.
