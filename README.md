# Wintergame
You are a penguin icefishing during winter. Is what the game was supposed to be but I think I shot too far this week
I'm burnt out, the fishing animations and the systems aren't working so I don't want to finish this one
This is my worst one.

Theme

This weeks theme was winter, the game's general setting is based off of winter and the player is a penguin.
The game has the aesthtic as well. (Snow falling, ice freezing over, snow covering the ground)
